# Normalized spec-record vocabulary

This directory holds reviewed, committed JSONL records for local specification
search. Each non-empty line is exactly one UTF-8 JSON object. A collection may
have no record file yet, but every row in a present record file must satisfy
this contract.

## Future ingestion seam

Todo 3 must expose `load_jsonl_records(path: Path)` from
`forge._shared.spec_search`. It returns validated records and raises
`SpecRecordValidationError` for malformed JSON, a non-object JSON value, a
missing required field, or a value with the wrong type. The error identifies
the input path and one-based line number. Invalid rows are never skipped or
silently repaired.

## Canonical row

`record_id` is a stable, lowercase, dot-delimited identifier. It is never
derived from a display title and must remain stable when wording changes.
`collection` selects the owning search collection; `domain`, `kind`, and
`entity` classify the record without imposing a global taxonomy. `title`,
`aliases`, and `content` are searchable text. `aliases` preserve English and
Vietnamese terms as authored; normalization and query expansion happen later.

## Required fields and stable types

| Field | Type | Semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `record_id` | non-empty string | Stable unique identifier within a collection. |
| `collection` | non-empty string | Collection key that owns the record. |
| `domain` | non-empty string | Domain grouping, such as `weapon-anatomy` or `pbr`. |
| `kind` | non-empty string | Record category, such as `component`, `material`, or `constraint`. |
| `entity` | non-empty string | Canonical entity or concept name. |
| `title` | non-empty string | Human-readable searchable title. |
| `aliases` | array of strings | Zero or more authored synonyms, including bilingual aliases where known. |
| `content` | string | Source-backed concise description; may be empty only when structured fields carry the searchable detail. |
| `constraints` | array of strings | Requirements, prohibitions, or caveats. |
| `measurements` | array of objects | Each object has non-empty string `name` and `value`; optional `unit` and `context` are strings. Values remain source text rather than invented numbers. |
| `source_refs` | non-empty array of objects | Provenance for the distilled statement. Every object has non-empty string `path` and may have non-empty string `heading` and/or `key_path`. |
| `evidence_refs` | array of objects | Supporting provenance. Every object has non-empty string `kind` and `ref`; optional `note` is a string. |
| `observation_status` | string | One of `observed`, `inferred`, or `unverified`. |
| `confidence` | number | Inclusive range `0.0` through `1.0`; confidence in the distilled statement, not search relevance. |
| `assumptions` | array of strings | Explicit assumptions that qualify the record. |

Records must preserve raw source locations. Use `heading` for a Markdown
section and `key_path` for a JSON location; a source reference may contain both
when a source format provides both forms of location. Paths are repository
relative and use forward slashes. `evidence_refs` may point to source files,
external identifiers, or review artifacts, but do not replace `source_refs`.

`observed` means directly supported by a cited source or reference artifact.
`inferred` means a reasoned interpretation retained with its assumptions.
`unverified` means useful terminology or a candidate claim that still needs
confirmation. Do not encode unsupported certainty: lower `confidence`, select
the appropriate status, and record the qualifying assumption instead.
