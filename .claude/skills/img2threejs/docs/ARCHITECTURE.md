# Architecture

The full mechanism behind img2threejs: how the staged pipeline runs, why it stays token-efficient, what each script does, and what artifacts you get out the other end. The [README](../README.md) covers the pitch and quick start; this doc covers how it actually works.

## Pipeline overview

The skill runs a staged sculpting pipeline. Scripts gate each stage; the agent's vision is the only thing that can approve a pass.

### Material reference hand-off

Material identity is an executable sub-pipeline rather than prose in the spec:

```text
named component region
  -> verified crop + observation
  -> material-reference.json resolver
  -> reference-derived PBR maps and bounded prior
  -> ObjectSculptSpec materialReference/materialPipeline
  -> generated material userData and color-space-safe maps
  -> multi-angle zoom/microscope capture
  -> per-region comparator and bounded feedback
  -> materialGate + material-pass unlock
```

`forge/materials/reference.py` is the runtime registry contract. The registry never decides from
colour alone and an ambiguous or low-confidence region remains `probe`/`request-input`. The
material gate also checks that UV/map bindings survive geometry, visual hull, skinning, collision,
morph and LOD changes. Existing specs without `materialPipeline` remain backward-compatible.

### Build passes

The model is sculpted in a fixed order; a pass unlocks only after the previous one is reviewed and accepted:

`blockout → structural-pass → form-refinement → material-pass → surface-pass → lighting-pass → interaction-pass → optimization-pass`

Each pass has its own acceptance criteria. A pass is marked `continue` only with a real render, a comparison sheet, an agent-vision score at or above threshold, and every identity-defining feature at or above its own threshold.

For resumable work, `forge/state.py` stores an atomic JSON checklist around this pipeline. Profile
steps for `character` and `cs2` are inserted before local spec authoring; correction counts are
bounded per pass and globally. `forge/next.py --state` reports the next ordered action and rejects
a positional spec that differs from the state artifact. This state index does not grant a pass:
the ObjectSculptSpec, render evidence, review history, and deterministic gates still decide.

### The gates

- **Suitability** — is the image a viable 3D target at all.
- **Pre-spec and strict-quality** — blocks code generation until the spec is deep enough for the object's complexity (no single-root spec for a compound object).
- **Screenshot feedback** — `continue` requires a render plus a comparison sheet plus a passing vision score.
- **Action-ready** — the model exposes a runtime hierarchy (pivots, sockets, colliders, destruction groups) via `root.userData.sculptRuntime`.
- **Attachment correctness** — child parts (handles, limbs, tubes) declare how they join their parent, so nothing floats in mid-air.
- **Material and lighting realism** — independent PBR channels and real lights, never albedo aliased into roughness.

### Self-correction

After every pass the agent chooses exactly one action: `continue`, `refine-spec`, `refine-code`, `request-input`, or `stop`. `refine-spec` fixes a wrong or shallow spec and re-validates; `refine-code` fixes geometry, material, or lighting that does not match a sound spec.

## Why it is token-efficient

Most image-to-3D agent loops burn tokens by asking the model to do mechanical work — re-reading the whole model every pass, scoring pixels, validating JSON by hand, re-running steps it already did. img2threejs pushes all of that into deterministic scripts and spends model tokens only where judgment is actually required.

- **Scripts enforce, the model judges.** The Python scripts handle validation, gating, spec authoring, PBR extraction, comparison-sheet packaging, and pipeline state. They never score visuals. The model's tokens go to one thing: looking at a single side-by-side sheet and deciding pass or fail.
- **Zero dependencies, zero install churn.** Every script is pure Python 3.10+ standard library. No pip, no PIL, no numpy, no Playwright. PNG read/write is done with `struct` and `zlib`. Nothing to install means nothing to debug in-context.
- **Pass-gated generation.** The code generator emits only the currently unlocked build pass. The model does not regenerate or re-read the entire model on every iteration — each step is small and scoped.
- **Fail fast, before codegen.** A strict-quality gate blocks shallow specs before a single line of Three.js is generated, so you never spend tokens rendering a model that was underspecified from the start.
- **One image per review.** Each pass is judged from exactly one packaged comparison sheet (reference beside render), not a scattering of screenshots.
- **Text output, not binaries.** The result is diffable TypeScript plus a JSON spec — small, reviewable, and version-controllable, instead of multi-megabyte mesh files.

The net effect: you still get a faithful 3D model from an image, but the expensive model context is reserved for visual judgment and code, not bookkeeping. For the full per-stage and per-cycle token breakdown, see [TOKEN_COST.md](TOKEN_COST.md).
