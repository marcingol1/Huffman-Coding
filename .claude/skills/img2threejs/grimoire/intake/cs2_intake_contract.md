# CS2 Intake Contract

Read this reference completely for every CS2 request before creating `cs2-intake.json` or running
pre-spec assessment. Do not advance the local checklist until its classification and manifest
requirements are satisfied.

For a CS2 item, the target is observable agreement between the supplied image and the rendered
item: silhouette, proportions, edge profile, hardware layout, coating colour, pattern placement,
wear, roughness response, and camera framing. Every decision must be traceable to evidence or be
labelled as an approximation.

The initial CS2 family boundary is **knife only**. Pistol, rifle, SMG, sniper, heavy, glove, and
unknown knife subtypes must stop with `unsupported-family` or `unsupported-subtype`; they must not
receive the knife component tree as a generic fallback.

## When to build `cs2-intake.json`

For a CS2 request, create and validate `cs2-intake.json` before pre-spec authoring. Run admission
and probing for every source view, record the heuristic signal as non-authoritative evidence,
attach the classification record, resolve the supported family, and choose `route` independently
from `exactnessTier`. Missing classification, insufficient coverage, or a contradictory
high-confidence class is `request-input`; unsupported families do not continue into spec
generation.

## Layer contract

Pass these records between layers. Do not copy an informal vision description into the next stage:

| Layer | Owns | Must emit | Must not decide alone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Intake | view validity and technical evidence | role, path/hash, resolution, coverage, duplicate status, admission verdict | item identity from aspect ratio or filename |
| Classification | semantic identity | family, subtype, confidence, evidence refs, provider/version, timeout state | geometry or finish parameters |
| Identity | skin/name/paint metadata | precedence, resolved values, ambiguity candidates, provenance | guessed paint index, float, or seed |
| Surface evidence | pixels and texture sources | de-lit reference, PBR channels, map provenance, colour space, UV orientation, confidence | albedo reused as roughness/normal/AO |
| Geometry adapter | family-specific form | component tree, topology, dimensions, edge/spine, hardware relationships, painted regions | hidden geometry without confidence notes |
| Spec/route | evidence-backed implementation choice | route, exactness tier, assumptions, feature targets, camera contract | exact-texture claim without exact evidence |
| Build/review | rendered observables | fixed view, two non-degenerate orbit views, per-region results, failed gates, next action | overriding a failed critical feature with a global score |

The canonical hand-off is `cs2-intake.json` (`schemaVersion: 1`). Its state is one of
`proceed`, `request-input`, `fallback`, `rejected`, `unsupported-family`, or
`unsupported-subtype`. Write it atomically and preserve unknown provider fields under
`extensions`; a fallback must never erase prior evidence.

## CS2 intake order

1. Admit and technically probe every view. Reject undecodable, empty, tiny, fragmented, or
   duplicate references before classification.
2. Record the heuristic CS2 signal only as a routing hint. `detect_cs2.py` is never authoritative
   identity evidence.
3. Require a classification record before selecting a family adapter. If classification is absent,
   timed out, or contradicts a high-confidence objectness result, return `request-input`.
4. Resolve identity in this order: explicit user metadata, uniquely resolved metadata, then the
   authoritative classification record. Preserve ambiguity rather than guessing.
5. Select route and exactness independently:
   - `reference-projection`: default for matching a specific patterned image;
   - `authored-texture`: only when independent texture maps are supplied or legally acquired;
   - `procedural-finish`: fallback when projection evidence is unavailable or live response is the
     stated priority.
   Exactness is `image-only`, `metadata-assisted`, or `exact-texture`; changing route must not
   silently upgrade or downgrade the evidence tier.
6. Select the knife adapter only after family/subtype validation. Record painted regions, unpainted
   substrate, visible hardware, hidden-region confidence, and every approximation in the spec.
7. For projection, solve the camera and de-light the source first. Projected pixels provide colour
   evidence, not automatic geometry truth; geometry still comes from the adapter and silhouette
   review.

## Surface and review rule

For a specific CS2 reference, preserve the reference's own colour/pattern pixels whenever legal and
technically possible. Procedural Doppler/Fade/Gamma/Marble patterns are not equivalent to the input
image and may only be used with an explicit `procedural-finish` route and approximation warning.
Keep albedo, roughness, metalness, normal/height, AO, mask, and wear as independent channels. Record
channel source, colour space, UV orientation, dimensions, packed-channel decoding, and missing-channel
derivation. A low-confidence PBR inference is a refine-input signal, not proof of exact material.

Single-view reconstruction may proceed only when visible identity features are sufficiently covered;
hidden blade sides, underside, and back hardware must carry inference confidence and may trigger
`request-input`. Review the fixed camera plus two meaningful orbit views. Report what changed, which
evidence caused it, what still differs, and choose exactly one next action:
`continue`, `refine-spec`, `refine-code`, `request-input`, or `stop`.
