# Self-Correction Loop Reference

Use this reference when a model construction pass has just finished.

## Transparency and Process Debugging (Critical — from Bowie Knife reconstruction)

**The problem:** When the user cannot tell what was done or where something went wrong, they cannot debug the process. Over-claiming (reporting success when features still don't match) destroys trust and makes iterative improvement impossible.

**Rule:** Be transparent + don't over-claim. State exactly what changed each pass, with evidence, and name what still doesn't match:
- After each pass, explicitly list what changed: "Updated guard shape to extend left edge from -0.56 to -0.48 for handle overlap"
- Provide evidence: reference the specific values, coordinates, or parameters that changed
- Name what still doesn't match: "Handle silhouette traced but still flat plane (no Z palm-swell), procedural crosshatch not reference's exact dot-grid knurl"
- Explain why a change was made: "Extended guard left edge because handle ends at X=-0.42 and guard ended at X=-0.20, causing visual gap"
- Never claim a feature is "done" when it's only "improved" — use precise language
- When a gate passes but visual inspection shows issues, explain the limitation: "2D gate passed (fidelity 0.83) but three-quarter render shows blade reads as toy (no grind wedge) — 2D gates are blind to 3D realism"

**The user needs to be able to debug the process, not just the output.** If something is wrong, they should be able to trace which decision led to the error and correct it. Opaque processes force restarts; transparent processes enable refinement.

## Review Order

1. Capture or collect a rendered screenshot for the current browser view.
2. Select at most five critical semantic systems for the current pass and only the suspicious important systems.
3. Create one full reference/render comparison sheet with `stage4_review/make_comparison_sheet.py`.
4. Inspect the sheet once with your agent's vision and score the global image, relevant visual layers, and each selected semantic feature visible in that pair.
5. Compare the rendered result to current `ObjectSculptSpec`.
6. Decide whether the mismatch is caused by the spec, the implementation, lighting/camera, missing evidence, or performance tradeoff.
7. Choose exactly one action:
   - `continue`
   - `refine-spec`
   - `refine-code`
   - `request-input`
   - `stop`
8. Record the screenshot paths, comparison image, overall score, layer scores, feature scores, and AI critique in `reviewHistory`.

For visual passes, `continue` requires a rendered screenshot, a comparison image, a global AI vision score at or above threshold, and every critical feature at or above its own threshold. Without them, the review is not evidence-backed enough. Pixel comparison code is never the acceptance authority.

## Root Cause Guide

Use `refine-spec` when:

- a component is missing or invented incorrectly
- the primitive family is wrong
- proportions or coordinate frame are wrong
- material layer is under-specified
- local features are missing from the spec
- evidence refs are absent or contradict the image
- user expectation cannot be represented by current build passes

Use `refine-code` when:

- the spec is clear but generated geometry is wrong
- material parameters were not implemented
- local masks/noise/wear are missing in code
- hierarchy/pivots do not match the spec
- browser render has obvious artifacts
- performance can be improved without changing the spec

Use `request-input` when:

- the image hides essential geometry
- material cannot be inferred from the provided view
- exact branding/text/ornament is required
- the requested fidelity is incompatible with a single image

Use `stop` when:

- target fidelity is reached
- user accepted current approximation
- remaining issues require new references, manual modeling, or non-procedural assets

## Fidelity Estimate

Use a practical 0-1 scale:

- `0.2`: only rough primitive placeholder
- `0.4`: silhouette recognizable, structure incomplete
- `0.6`: macro and meso forms mostly correct, material/detail weak
- `0.75`: object reads correctly, local details approximate
- `0.85`: strong procedural match for real-time use
- `0.95`: near-reference, usually requires multiple views or manual art

Do not claim `0.9+` from a single ambiguous image unless the object is simple and symmetrical.

## Divine Eye caveat — photo-vs-procedural reconstruction (must read)

When the reference is a **photograph** and the render is a **procedural reconstruction**, the pixel-aligned signals (`ssim`, `edgeOverlap`) and the silhouette-IoU hard gate are dominated by **framing + background + scale + lighting** differences, NOT fidelity. Confirmed on two objects: a faithful BMX scored `reject/0.53`, a clear M9 bayonet scored `reject/IoU 0.165` (white-bg photo vs dark render). 

**Do not chase the Eye's global score in this mode** — optimising toward it distorts the model trying to pixel-match a photo (impossible) and makes it worse. Instead:
- Judge each pass against its **own goal** with agent vision (silhouette reads? part present? palette on-tone?).
- Trust the **palette ΔE / phash / part-presence**, and IoU only **after** scale+translation alignment.
- Treat `ssim`/`edgeOverlap` vs a photo as advisory, never a hard fail.

The proper fix is a Divine-Eye **reconstruction mode** (reference==photo ⇒ drop pixel-aligned signals, align-then-IoU, palette+objectness) — this is exactly what the deferred **OSIM** objectness signal targets (feature-map similarity is invariant to lighting/background). See `docs/PLAN_1.3_FINAL.md` review log + ws-memories atom `divine-eye-photo-vs-procedural-miscalibration`.

**Update (2026-07-22): the reconstruction-mode rescue now exists.** `divine_eye.py` computes a stdlib
`objectness` signal (`objectness.py`, OSIM-lite — bg/pose/scale/brightness-invariant HOG cosine) and,
when a photo-vs-procedural render fails *only* the IoU hard gate but objectness says "same object"
(≥0.48), it downgrades the confident reject to `probe` and sets `reconstructionModeSuspected:true`. So the
Eye no longer hard-rejects a faithful reconstruction on framing alone — but still never auto-passes it.

## 2D Gates Are Blind to 3D Realism (Critical — from Bowie Knife reconstruction)

**The problem:** 2D visual gates (Divine Eye, diagnose_render) only measure silhouette + colour + tone. They cannot see:
- Edge sharpness (a constant-thickness slab reads as a toy cutout even with perfect silhouette)
- Cross-section thickness (blade grind, taper, bevel quality)
- Material realism (metal vs plastic reflection, surface texture response)
- True 3D form beyond the silhouette plane

**Consequence:** A strict-PASS at fidelity 0.83 can still read as a flat toy in a three-quarter render.

**Rule:** NEVER report a 2D-gate PASS as "done". Always judge 3D realism on a three-quarter render, and explicitly state what the gate does/doesn't measure in your review notes. When a gate passes but the 3D render looks wrong, the gate measurement was insufficient — not the reconstruction.

**Verification cues:** A procedural object is failing 3D realism when:
- The silhouette matches but edges are perfectly sharp/flat (no grind, taper, or bevel)
- Material has correct color but wrong surface response (plastic when should be metal, etc.)
- Reference depth cues (grind transitions, material thickness, edge bevels) are missing or flat
- The gate score is high but the object reads as "toy-like" or "cardboard" in angled views
