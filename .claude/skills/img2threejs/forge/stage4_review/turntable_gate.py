"""Mandatory turntable coverage gate with interior-hole (background-enclosure) detection.

``diagnose_render_multi_angle`` is reference-free and checks exactly one thing:
does the silhouette AREA collapse when the object is orbited (the billboard
test). That leaves two holes an area-only check cannot see through:

1. **Coverage was never mandatory.** Reviews were historically captured from
   the front only, so defects that exist solely off-axis survived multiple
   review rounds -- a conical hat mounted at hip height instead of behind the
   shoulders, a weapon passing through the body, a charm floating detached
   below the ground plane. None of those are visible from the front. This
   module makes a minimum set of orbit azimuths (front/right/back/left by
   default) MANDATORY: a missing required angle is a gate FAILURE, not a
   warning, because making the turntable mandatory is the entire point.

2. **A hole through the model is invisible to an area test.** A character's
   eye socket was pushed clean through the back of its skull; viewed from
   behind there is a hole through the head. Silhouette AREA barely changes
   (the head is still roughly the same size), so the existing area-collapse
   check passes. But that hole is an enclosed BACKGROUND region trapped
   INSIDE the silhouette -- trivially detectable with a flood fill, at zero
   token cost. This module flood-fills the background from the image border
   and flags any background pixel the fill never reaches: it is enclosed by
   the foreground, i.e. a hole through the object.

Important caveat: a legitimately holed subject exists (a ring, a door
handle, the negative space between an arm and a torso). "holed" here means
only "the silhouette encloses background at this angle" -- it is a defect
just when the subject is NOT supposed to have a through-hole there. Callers
that expect legitimate holes must pass ``allow_holes=True`` /
``--allow-holes`` to keep that signal from failing the gate.

Scope: like its sibling, this module only ANALYZES already-captured PNGs.
Driving a renderer to produce the orbit captures is handled elsewhere.

    subject is not clearly separable from its background it warns "image is not
    clearly isolated from background" and returns MOST PIXELS as foreground.
    That is the right answer for its original caller, which wants a broad pixel
    sample for material evidence, and completely wrong here — a mask covering
    the whole frame makes the silhouette meaningless, the area ratio ~1.0 for
    every angle, and the enclosed-background holes pure noise.

    This is not hypothetical. Run against a real review turntable rendered on a
    dark gradient background, the gate reported ``area=0.9966`` per angle and a
    confident PASS while never once measuring the character. A gate that cannot
    see its subject must say so, not pass. Its sibling module already hardens
