"""Detect a surface that has folded through its own volume, on a mesh whose topology is valid.

`geometry_integrity.mesh_edge_counts` counts `boundaryEdges` (an edge used by one triangle) and
`nonManifoldEdges` (an edge used by more than two). Those are the only geometry facts any gate in
this repository checks, and they are both topological. A real production defect walked straight
through them: a character's eye-socket recess was pushed deeper than the skull's local half-depth,
so the front surface passed THROUGH the back of the skull and emerged out the occiput. From behind
there was a clean hole through the head. The mesh was still perfectly closed -- boundaryEdges 0,
nonManifoldEdges 0 -- because pushing existing vertices around changes no connectivity at all. Every
existing gate passed it.

Self-intersection is a GEOMETRIC defect on a TOPOLOGICALLY VALID mesh. Edge counts cannot see it,
by construction. This module is the check that can.

Method: ray parity. Take a point on the surface, step a small epsilon along its outward direction,
and ask whether that point -- which by definition should be just OUTSIDE the object -- is in fact
inside the object's own volume. On a closed surface the answer is decided by counting how many of
the mesh's own triangles a ray from that point crosses: odd means inside. A point that is supposed
to be outside its own surface but measures inside can only mean the surface folded through itself
there.

Everything here is deterministic. No `random`, no sampling jitter, no wall-clock or hash-order
dependence: the same mesh yields the same verdict and the same reported positions every run, which
is what makes a gate's output reviewable.
