"""Attachment Anchor Gate: does every worn/held item actually relate to what it hangs from?

Two production defects share one root cause. A conical hat that should sit behind the
character's shoulders rendered at hip height, off to one side. A charm that should hang from
the butt of a staff rendered detached, four units away and below the ground plane. Measured:
the hat's bounding box spanned y 1.107-4.064 while the shoulder joint sat at y 3.829; the charm
sat 0.389 from the staff surface with no connecting geometry at all. Both were authored as
children of the model ROOT rather than of the thing they are attached to, so nothing tied
their world position to their anchor, and nothing checked it afterward. No gate in this repo
relates a worn or held item to what it is worn on or held by -- `ATTACHMENT_ROLES` in
validate_sculpt_spec.py is a DIFFERENT contract (limbs/branches/handles that must EMBED into
their parent's geometry, via `attachment.parentSocket`/`localStart`/`localEnd`); it has nothing
to say about a rigid item that merely has to sit near a bone or component it is not welded to.

Five checks. The first four run over the spec alone; the fifth only runs when the caller
supplies measured world positions (e.g. from a runtime parts manifest), because that is the
only way to catch a hat that is correctly *declared* but wrongly *placed*.

  ANCHOR_DECLARED    every worn/held/hung component must name an anchor.
  ANCHOR_RESOLVES    the named anchor must be a real component, or (with a rig) a real bone.
  ANCHOR_NOT_ROOT    the anchor must not be the model ROOT -- the literal bug both defects
                     shared: parenting to root means the item's transform carries no
                     relationship at all to the body part it belongs to.
  ANCHOR_NOT_CYCLIC  following anchors must not loop, and an item must not anchor to itself.
  ANCHOR_PROXIMITY   (measured positions only) the item's measured position must sit within
                     its anchor's declared or defaulted `maxOffset`.

A component missing from the measured positions is never silently treated as passing --
it is reported in `unmeasuredAttachments`, because "0 violations" from a check that never
ran on anything is the exact failure mode that let both defects ship.
