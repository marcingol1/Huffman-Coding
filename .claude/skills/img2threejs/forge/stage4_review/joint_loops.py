"""Does the mesh carry enough edge loops at each joint to survive being bent?

A skinned joint with too few rings of geometry across it collapses when it flexes: the elbow pinches
into a crease, the knee loses its volume, the shoulder creases into a fold. No amount of weight
tuning fixes it, because there is simply nothing there to deform -- the vertices needed to describe a
bent surface do not exist.

The usual answer to this in a mesh-generation pipeline is retopology, and the honest industry position
is that automatic remeshing does NOT reliably produce deformation-grade topology; people still
retopologize by hand. But that constraint belongs to pipelines that receive a finished mesh. A
procedural generator writes its own topology, so it can place loops at joints BY CONSTRUCTION and
never need to repair them afterwards. This module is the gate that makes that a requirement rather
than a hope.

Method: for each joint, take the vertices within a radius of it, project them onto the bone axis, and
count how many distinct bands along that axis they occupy. Bands, not raw vertex count: ten thousand
vertices in two rings still cannot bend, and counting vertices would call that mesh dense and pass it.

The gate deliberately does not try to identify true quad edge loops. Recovering loop structure from a
triangle soup is fragile, and the property that actually matters for deformation -- enough
independently movable rings across the joint -- is exactly what band counting measures.

Pure Python 3.10+ stdlib.
