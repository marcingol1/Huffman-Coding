"""Does one part pass through another?

`self_intersection.py` catches a surface folded through ITS OWN volume. It says nothing about two
separate meshes occupying the same space, and that is a different, equally common defect: an arm
inside a torso, a staff through a hat, a strap sunk into a shoulder. Each mesh is individually
flawless, so every per-mesh gate passes, and the model is still broken.

Method: ray parity again, but across meshes. Sample vertices of A, count crossings of B's triangles
along a fixed direction; odd means the vertex is inside B. As in the sibling module, a grazing hit is
reported as UNDECIDED rather than rounded into a verdict, and the sampling budget is reported so a
clean result over a strided sample is never mistaken for a clean result over the whole mesh.

Touching is not penetrating. A hand gripping a staff shares a surface, and a gate that flagged that
would be useless on exactly the models it is meant to check, so `allowedPairs` exists for parts that
are supposed to be in contact and `penetrationDepth` distinguishes a skim from a part buried inside
another.
