"""Per-feature verification for the img2threejs review stage.

A high *global* fidelity score can still hide a wrong or missing
identity-defining feature (a blade tip, a logo, a recurved hook). This
module verifies EACH declared feature independently against its own
threshold and fails the pass when a *gating* feature is missing or below
its threshold — even if the global score passed.

Operationalizes SKILL.md's rule: "fail a pass if an identity-defining
feature is wrong even when the global score looks fine."

Pure-logic module: it consumes already-computed per-feature scores and
decides pass/fail. It does NOT load or inspect images. Stdlib only.

    grid, where a few-pixel feature does not exist. The tier machinery here is correct; feeding it
    feature-scale numbers is the missing half. See grimoire/review/divine_eye_microscope.md.
