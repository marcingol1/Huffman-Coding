"""Morph targets: position deltas for expression, and correctives for what skinning cannot do.

Nothing in this repository emitted morph targets, which closes off two things a character needs.

The obvious one is facial expression. Bones can drive a jaw, but a blink, a sneer or a brow raise is
surface motion with no skeleton behind it, and Three.js supports it natively through
`morphAttributes.position` -- a morph target is just a second position buffer, so this needs no new
runtime machinery at all.

The less obvious one matters more for a rigged character: CORRECTIVE shapes. Linear blend skinning
always loses volume as a joint closes -- an elbow at 120 degrees pinches, a shoulder collapses -- and
no weight assignment fixes it, because the artefact is in the interpolation, not in the weights. The
repair is a shape that fades in as the joint bends and puts the volume back.

Deltas, not absolute positions. Three.js `morphAttributes` with `morphTargetsRelative` expects
offsets from the base, storing an absolute copy of every vertex per target multiplies memory by the
number of targets, and a delta array is mostly zeros and compresses to nothing.

Pure Python 3.10+ stdlib.
