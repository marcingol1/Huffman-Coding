"""Milestone 0 rig kill test.

Question this answers: can a generator EMIT a working skinned rig from a
RigSpec, or not? See docs/PLAN_1.5_ANIMATION_READY_RIGS.md.

This is a REAL-RUN test only. It emits TypeScript from a hand-written RigSpec
(forge/stage5_rig/emit_rig.py), executes that emitted code with the
showcase's real `three` via a Node subprocess
(img2threejs-showcase/scripts/rig-milestone0.mjs), and gates on numbers read
back from the executed geometry. No mock, no hand-computed expectation. If
the subprocess cannot run or does not produce a parseable result, this test
fails closed and loudly (a missing showcase checkout, a missing `node`, or an
unexecutable emit are all treated as a Milestone 0 FAIL, not a skip).

Reproduce standalone:
    node <showcase>/scripts/rig-milestone0.mjs <emitted.ts> --out result.json

Pure Python 3.10+ stdlib on this side. No pip installs.

    exemption branch in gate (b) has never actually fired on that path. That
    proves the counter reads zero when nothing qualifies; it does not prove
    an on-axis vertex is correctly classified when one exists.

    `node scripts/rig-milestone0.mjs --self-check` runs four hand-placed
    synthetic cases (on the rotation axis; on the axis but offset along it;
    5e-7 from it; 2e-6 from it) through the SAME perpendicularDistanceFromAxis()
    gate (b) uses (see scripts/rig-milestone0-axis.mjs) — not a
    reimplementation, so a broken real predicate cannot pass by comparing
    against a second broken copy of itself. This test asserts the
    classifications from that JSON, plus an analytic cross-check of the
    off-axis displacements against the closed-form 90-degree chord length
    (distance * sqrt(2)) rather than against a recorded constant, so a wrong
    implementation cannot pass by matching a number this test previously
    happened to observe.

    Deliberately does NOT touch RING_RESOLUTION_DIVISOR, N, or any capsule
    geometry -- per team-lead's instruction, this is a synthetic case built
    for exactly this purpose, not a perturbation of the derived tessellation.

    NOTE (2026-07-30): the 'on-axis-offset-along-axis' case and the
    analytic cross-check were folded in from a standalone
    scripts/rig-milestone0-axis-exemption.test.mjs, which team-lead found
    was never wired into any npm script or CI path (package.json's
    test:review-apparatus lists explicit files, not a glob) -- so it always
    passed by hand and never ran otherwise. That file has been deleted;
