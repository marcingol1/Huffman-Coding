"""Measure boundary/non-manifold edges on every emitted primitive, real-executed.

Nothing in the suite measured this before this file existed. See
docs/PLAN_1.5_ANIMATION_READY_RIGS.md and the WS-E capsule fix in
generate_threejs_factory.py.

Two distinct properties are measured per primitive, both real-executed (tsc + node,
same pattern as test_hierarchy_scale.py) rather than hand-computed:

  - `raw`: boundary/non-manifold edges on the geometry's own index buffer, exactly
    as emitted -- no welding, no dedup.
  - `welded`: TRUE topology, identifying vertices by rounded position (the same
    1e-6-precision key subdivideCatmullClark's own `vertexIndexAt` uses) and
    dropping any triangle that becomes degenerate under that identity -- exactly
    what subdivideCatmullClark does before it ever builds an edge graph. This is
    deliberately NOT a plain `BufferGeometryUtils.mergeVertices()` call: mergeVertices
    re-indexes vertices but keeps every triangle reference, including ones that
    become degenerate after the merge, and a degenerate triangle (a, a, b)
    double-counts the surviving edge (a, b) -- producing a "non-manifold" reading
    for topology that is actually a perfectly ordinary closed 2-manifold. This
    exact mistake is why an earlier version of this file, and the report that
    preceded it, wrongly concluded the raw capsule was non-manifold (see the
    capsule finding below) -- corrected once the discrepancy between "mergeVertices
    says non-manifold" and "the real subdivideCatmullClark completes without
    throwing" was run down to its root cause instead of accepted at face value.

Findings encoded as assertions here (each verified by running this exact
tsc+node harness against the TRUE-topology method above, not by inspecting source
or trusting a single measurement tool):

  - box, cylinder, sphere, ellipsoid, torus, instanced-cluster (defaults to a box
    base), extrude, curve-sweep, capsule: 0/0 once welded by true position identity.
    Their raw boundary count is the normal, benign UV-seam duplication every
    textured three.js primitive has; welding proves the underlying topology is
    genuinely closed. capsule (built via buildWatertightCapsule, not
    THREE.CapsuleGeometry) is additionally 0/0 even RAW, with no degenerate
    triangles at all -- closed by construction, not by a weld.
  - cone: 0/0 once welded -- but the ORIGINAL construction (heightSegments=16,
    CYLINDER_HEIGHT_SEGMENTS) measured 2448 raw / 2160 welded boundary edges, with
    ZERO degenerate triangles filtered -- a GENUINE topology defect, verified with
    this exact rigorous method, unrelated to the capsule's degenerate-triangle
    counting artifact. A tapering cone does not weld cleanly at 16 height segments
    the way a constant-radius cylinder does. Fixed by giving cone its own
    CONE_HEIGHT_SEGMENTS=1 (three.js's own default). The subdivision-requested
    substitute geometry (a near-degenerate CylinderGeometry) is untouched.
  - plane-card, tube, lathe (with the generator's default open profile): boundary
    edges are EXPECTED and correct -- these are not closed solids by design (a flat
    card, an open-ended pipe, and a lathed profile that never touches the axis at
    either end all have a real physical edge).
  - ground-blade: CONFIRMED, UNFIXED topology defect, found while building this
    measurement (a fully custom-built BufferGeometry, not a three.js primitive) --
    measures 6 real boundary edges under true topology (an actual open/unclosed
    region; a 7th "non-manifold" edge from an earlier, mergeVertices-based
    measurement was the same degenerate-triangle counting artifact as the capsule's
    -- one harmless zero-area sliver triangle, correctly excluded here). Off the
    humanoid character's component path (no ground-blade components), small,
    reported to team-lead and left as-is by direction; pinned here as an
    exact-count tripwire so it cannot silently get worse.
