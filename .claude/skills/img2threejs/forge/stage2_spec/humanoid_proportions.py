"""Canonical humanoid proportions, so a reference-free stylized figure can be specified.

`validate_sculpt_spec.py` blocks any character spec whose `anatomy.applies` is not true, and
tells the author to "fill anatomy (styleHeads, proportions, pose, faceLandmarks) from the
reference". That is the right demand when there IS a reference: a specific person's
proportions are evidence, and a canon table would be a fabrication of that evidence.

But it also made a reference-free request impossible to express. "Build me a 4-head stylized
low-poly humanoid" has no reference to measure, and the canon it should follow is public
figure-drawing convention, not an invented number. This module supplies that canon and marks
it as canon, so the two cases stay distinguishable downstream: anatomy derived here carries
`source: "canon-table"`, never `"reference"`.

## Provenance of every number below

Cited to the low-poly humanoid research corpus (NotebookLM notebook
`ab7334f3-818b-427d-a7eb-96c0581d812f`, 77 sources) or marked DEFINITIONAL where the value
follows from the head-unit system itself rather than from a source.

| Landmark            | 8-head  | 4-head  | Provenance   |
|---------------------|---------|---------|--------------|
| head height / H     | 0.125   | 0.25    | DEFINITIONAL (1/styleHeads) |
| shoulder width / H  | 0.25    | --      | research     |
| waist width / H     | 0.125   | --      | research     |
| hip width / H       | 0.1875  | --      | research     |
| hip line Y / H      | 0.50    | --      | research     |
| knee line Y / H     | 0.25    | --      | research     |
| upper arm / H       | 0.187   | 0.125   | research     |
| forearm / H         | 0.187   | 0.125   | research     |
| shin / H            | 0.25    | 0.125   | research     |

Values the research corpus did NOT supply are absent rather than guessed: chest width,
shoulder Y, waist Y, hand length, thigh length, foot length. `derive_anatomy()` reports them
in `unsourced` so a caller can see what it is NOT being told, instead of receiving a
confident-looking number nobody measured. Filling them in later is a research task, not an
editing task.
