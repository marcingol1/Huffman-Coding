# Plan 1.5 — the recessed-feature gate (the US-004 defect: "the eye reads as a patch, not
# a recessed socket"). This is a spec-authoring failure, not a measurement failure, and it
# is undetectable downstream: a silhouette gate cannot see an interior concavity (a dimple
# inside the outline changes no silhouette in any view), and a dark-pixel ratio on a
# concave feature measures cavity SHADING, not material (the reference ear reads 14.3%
# "dark" from shading gradient alone, peaking at luminance 60-79, versus the wing's 32.9%
# near-black from actual material). So this class of defect has to be caught in the schema.
#
# How a component declares "recessed": we extend the existing free-text `role` field
# (already token-matched by ATTACHMENT_ROLES / component_requires_attachment below) rather
# than invent a parallel boolean field. A spec author names the part's role with one of
# these tokens (`role: "eye-socket"`, `"ear-canal"`, `"mouth-cavity"`, `"nostril"`, ...);
# `component.name`/`id` are checked too since components are commonly named after the
# feature they are. This was chosen over (a) a new `concave: true` field, which would be a
# second place to encode the same fact `role` already carries and would need its own
# authoring discipline, and (b) reusing `topologyClass` itself, which describes HOW a part
# is built, not WHAT it represents -- the whole point of this gate is to compare the two.
#
# Token design, revised after review — plain "socket" collides with a DIFFERENT, load-
# bearing meaning already in this file: ATTACHMENT_ROLES (below) uses bare "socket" for an
# attachment POINT (`attachment.parentSocket`, `actionProfile.sockets[]`), e.g. a handle's
# hilt socket. That is a real, common authoring case and is not a concavity, so bare
# "socket" is deliberately NOT a recessed-feature token. Instead we match the specific
# compound "eyesocket" as a normalized substring (hyphens/spaces/underscores stripped, so
# `role: "eye-socket"`, `"eye_socket"`, and `"eye socket"` all match) -- narrower than a
# bare word, so it cannot fire on a plain attachment socket. "hollow" and "concave" are
# real words but too easily legitimate outside a cavity context ("hollow tube", "concave
# lens" are both real, non-recessed parts), so they are matched against `role` ONLY, never
# against `name`/`id`, keeping them out of reach of incidental part-naming collisions.
# "dimple" was dropped entirely: a dimple is shallow by definition, so it is the wrong word
# to hold to a depth-requiring rule (below) in the first place.
#
# THE CONTRACT, spelled out because the rule below is now strict (allow-list: implicit +
# subtract, nothing else) and that strictness needs to be a stated trade, not a trap:
# the token IS the declaration. If a component's role/name/id calls it a cavity, canal, or
# recess, this rule holds it to building a REAL one. A shallow decorative relief -- a 0.2mm
# panel line, a knurl pattern -- is not a cavity; do not name it one. Rename it instead
# (e.g. `panel-relief`, `groove-relief`) and it is untouched by this gate, free to be
# `surface-relief` or any other topologyClass. That is the legitimate way out, and
# `test_shallow_relief_panel_without_a_cavity_token_is_accepted` in
# forge/tests/test_recessed_and_open_shell_topology.py proves it actually works.

# let a THIRD route to the exact same US-004 defect through: `topologyClass:

    # ---- MONOTONIC_CHAIN ----
    # §5.2 words this as "cumulative length along a limb chain must increase monotonically; no
    # bone may fold back through its parent". READING CHOSEN: the operative clause is the second.
    #
    # I first implemented the first clause as euclidean distance from the root joint to each tip,
    # and it REJECTED the correct 49-bone template on ten bones — which is the strongest possible
    # evidence that a check is mis-specified rather than the model being wrong. The reason is
    # anatomy: a clavicle reaches 0.70 up at the shoulder, then the upper arm hangs DOWN so its
    # tip lands at 0.49, back toward the hips. Distance-from-root is legitimately non-monotonic
    # for any chain that goes out then down. (Read as arc length the clause is trivially true,
    # since bone lengths are positive, so that cannot be the intent either.)
    #
    # So this compares DIRECTION. A bone folds back only when it points substantially opposite
    # its parent. The threshold is generous on purpose: a thumb sits near 90 degrees to the palm
    # and must pass, while a genuinely inverted bone sits near 180 and must not.
