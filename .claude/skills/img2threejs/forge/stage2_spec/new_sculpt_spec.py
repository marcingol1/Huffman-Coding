    """A stylized GENERAL HUMANOID template: head/neck/torso/pelvis, full arms (upper arm ->
    forearm -> hand) and full legs (thigh -> shin -> foot), face features including recessed
    eye sockets, and hair. Head-unit driven; HU ~= 0.28 world units. Reads
    preSpecAssessment.anatomy.proportions (torso/legs/shoulderWidth/hipWidth, in head units)
    when supplied, else falls back to stylized full-body defaults (~7.5 heads tall).

    Glasses, headphones, and a chest decal are NOT part of the baseline -- they were traits of
    one specific reference person, not general humanoid anatomy. Pass include_accessories=True
    to restore them. Digits ARE baseline (US-003): five per hand, three phalanges each.

    REAL NESTED HIERARCHY (worker-flatten's WS-E fix has landed: a pivot Group always carries
    identity scale and a part's dimensions are baked into its own geometry, so a non-uniformly
    scaled parent can no longer distort a nested child -- see generate_threejs_factory.py). So,
    unlike the earlier revision of this function, every part below is parented on its real
    anatomical parent (neck -> torso, head -> neck, upper-arm -> torso, forearm -> upper-arm,
    hand -> forearm, thigh -> pelvis, shin -> thigh, foot -> shin, face features -> head, ...),
    not flattened onto a single hidden root.

    Layout math below is still computed as absolute joint coordinates in one shared coordinate
    space (torso_top_pt, shoulder_pt, hip_pt, ...) because that keeps the trig/anatomy formulas
    simple and easy to check by eye. Each point is then converted to the LOCAL space of the
    component's real parent with `_rel(point, parent_id)` immediately before it is authored onto
    a component -- Three.js interprets a child's position/attachment endpoints relative to its
    own parent Group, not the world, so this conversion is required once nesting is real.
    `world_anchor[parent_id]` tracks, for every already-built component, the point that becomes
    its own pivot Group's world position (its attachment localStart for limb/spine segments, or
    its own authored position for a plain part) so `_rel()` can look it up.

    """Derive a PLAN_1.5 §6 `RigSpec` from the component tree instead of authoring one.

    Deriving rather than authoring is the point: a hand-written skeleton and a
    hand-written component tree drift the moment either is edited, and nothing
    detects the drift. Everything below comes from data the tree already carries.

    Three decisions that are choices rather than facts, recorded here because the
    next person cannot re-derive them from the code alone:

    1. **Every position is MODEL space, and a bone's tip is its child's joint.**
       `attachment.localEnd` looks like the obvious tip and is NOT used, because it
       is right for limbs and wrong for the spine: a limb component's origin IS its
       proximal joint, but the torso's origin is its centre, so reading localEnd
       there produced a spine bone running from the chest DOWN past the pelvis --
       which would have pulled leg vertices onto the torso's weight. PLAN_1.5 §6's
       "tipPos defaults to the child's jointPos" is the right rule but is
       meaningless parent-local (a parent's tip and its child's joint sit in
       different frames), so everything is accumulated into one space first.

    2. **`pelvis` is the single bone root, with `torso` parented to it.** A
       `RigSpec` requires exactly one root, and the component tree parents BOTH
       `torso` and `pelvis` to `"root"` (they are siblings there). Hips-as-root is
       the standard humanoid convention and it is the one that makes rotating the
       pelvis bend the whole figure. This makes the bone hierarchy deliberately
       differ from the pivot hierarchy at exactly one edge, which PLAN_1.5 §8
       ("bones and pivots coexist") explicitly permits.

    3. **A leaf bone continues its parent's direction** for its own `scale.y`,
       rather than being given an invented orientation. Known simplification: a
       foot therefore points down the shin rather than forward. That is wrong
       anatomically and right for weighting, and it is derived rather than
       guessed -- flagged so a real foot orientation can replace it deliberately.

    Why this is worth having even though skinning (WS-C) is unfinished: posing a hierarchy of
    RIGID segments needs no skeleton at all. It needs a real parent chain that propagates
    rotation, which the template now has and which has been measured on executed geometry.
    Skinning buys smooth deformation ACROSS a joint; it is not what makes a limb move. So a
    reference pose (a contrapposto, an arm resting on a sword) is reachable now, and treating
    pose as blocked on skinning was wrong.

    Before this, `pose.jointAngles` was declared in two places and consumed in none -- the same
    "accepted but silently unused" state `anatomy.proportions` was in before `_hu_ratio()`.

    MUST run AFTER `derive_character_rig()`. That function accumulates joints by summing
    parent-local offsets, which is only valid while every ancestor rotation is identity -- i.e.
    at bind pose. It now raises rather than silently mis-deriving if called on a posed tree, so
    the ordering is enforced, not merely documented. The rig stays bind-pose data, which is what
